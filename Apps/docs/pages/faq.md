# FAQ

## Why no build step?

This project uses Tailwind v4 browser build and DaisyUI CDN for simplicity.

## Can I add more pages?

Yes, create new `.md` files under `Apps/docs/pages/` and add an entry into the `PAGES` array in `Apps/docs/index.js`.

## How do I change themes?

Use the theme switcher in the header; it persists to localStorage.
